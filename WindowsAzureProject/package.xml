			Attributes:

			packagefilename:
					(Required) The name, including the extension but not the full path, of the deployment package or 
					folder to be built. By convention, if creating a package file for deployment to the cloud 
					(packagetype="cloud"), use the *.cspkg extension. If creating only a directory layout for local 
					testing in the development fabric (packagetype="True"), use the *.csx extension.

			[configurationfilename]:
					The name, including the extension but not the full path, of the cloud service configuration file (*.cscfg).
					This file must exist in the root directory of the project (see the projectDir attribute). 
					If not specified, the default name "ServiceConfiguration.cscfg" will be assumed.
			
			[definitionfilename]:
					The name, including the extension but not the full path, of the cloud service definition file (*.csdef). 
					This file must exist in the root directory of the project (see the projectdir attribute).
					If not specified, the default name "ServiceDefinition.csdef" is assumed.

			[emulatortoolsdir]:
					The directory where the emulator tools will be created by the build process.
					If not specified, the default "emulatorTools" directory in the project directory 
					will be used.

			[packagedir]: 
					The target directory of the deployment package file or folder. 
					If not specified, "<projectdir>/deploy" will be used.

			[packagetype = {cloud | local}]
					cloud:	(default) Builds a package file for deployment to the Windows Azure cloud, for example via the Windows 
							Azure management portal.
					local:	Creates a package directory layout for local testing in the Windows Azure Compute 
							Emulator and a command script (csrun.cmd) for you to start your cloud service in the development 
							fabric more easily.

			[projectdir]:
					The root directory of the project. The service definition (*.csdef) and service configuration (*.cscfg) 
					files are expected to exist there. If not specified, the task will attempt to determine the project 
					directory automatically.

			[sdkdir]: 
					The directory of the cspack.exe tool. If not specified, an attempt will be made to find it automatically.
			
			[emulatordir]:
					The directory of the Windows Azure Emulator installation. If not specified, an attempt will be made to find it automatically.
