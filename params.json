{"name":"Cloudninja-for-java","body":"## CloudNinja for Java\r\n\r\nThe CloudNinja project is an existing sample .NET application that demonstrates how to develop multi-tenant applications for the Windows Azure platform. Using this existing model, Persistent Systems has developed a similar sample Web application called CloudNinja for JAVA to help the JAVA community develop JAVA applications for Windows Azure. The CloudNinja for JAVA application will help JAVA developers to implement best practices and design patterns that are required for JAVA multi-tenant applications on Windows Azure. \r\n\r\nThe CloudNinja for JAVA application encompasses the following points:\r\n\r\n* Tenant on boarding\r\n* Tenant level customization (for example, managing logos)\r\n* Providing support for log-in via different identity providers (for example, Yahoo!, Google, Windows Live ID)\r\n\r\nThis application also demonstrates how to use the various Windows Azure Services such as:\r\n\r\n* ACS\r\n* Windows Azure Storage\r\n* SQL Azure database and so on.\r\n\r\nKey functionalities of a multi-tenant application are:\r\n\r\n* Provisioning new Tenant\r\n* Data isolation for Tenant\r\n* Federated Identity\r\n* Metering for Tenant\r\n\r\nHopefully, the CloudNinja for JAVA application will help the JAVA community and encourage JAVA developers to create their own applications for Windows Azure.\r\n","tagline":"Multi-tenant Java application for Windows Azure","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
